# FineTuning_Falcon-7b-LLM-Model_on-Custom-Data
- This repository provides a step-by-step guide for fine-tuning the Falcon 7B Model using the Hugging Face ecosystem, including Transformers, PEFT, and BitsAndBytes for efficient parameter tuning and quantization. The notebook demonstrates how to optimize large language models for custom downstream tasks while maintaining high efficiency in environments with limited GPU resources.

## Key Features
#### Installation of Dependencies:

- Sets up the required Python libraries such as accelerate, peft, bitsandbytes, and transformers for fine-tuning.
  
#### Efficient Fine-Tuning:

- Utilizes LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of the Falcon 7B model.
Employs 4-bit quantization using BitsAndBytesConfig to reduce memory usage and enable training on hardware with limited GPU resources.

### Dataset Integration:
- Loads and processes datasets using Hugging Face's datasets library for fine-tuning tasks.

#### Custom Prompt Templates:
- Implements structured templates for system prompts, user prompts, and model responses to guide training in a conversational framework.

#### Model Configuration:
- Includes configurable training arguments such as batch size, gradient accumulation, learning rate, and optimizer settings.

#### Trainer Workflow:
- Leverages the SFTTrainer from the transformers library for supervised fine-tuning.
